 NextGenAi is a generative AI application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It leverages the Gemini API to handle AI-driven processes, enabling the generation of unique content based on user inputs. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database to store user data and AI-generated content. The frontend is built with React.js to offer a seamless and interactive experience. This project showcases the integration of generative AI and modern web technologies, providing users with an innovative platform to explore AI-generated content.
